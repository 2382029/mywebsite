    <h1>My Holiday</h1>
    
    <div class="story">
        <p><strong>Written by: Daryl Grandy Karundeng - 2382029</strong></p>
        <p>Hello, my name is Daryl Grandy Karundeng. I want to share my experiences during this holiday, particularly regarding the sports activities I participated in.</p>
            
        <p>During the holidays, I was very active in playing basketball. Every day, I made time to practice at the basketball court near my house with friends. We usually practiced for two hours every afternoon, focusing not only on fundamental techniques but also playing small games to enhance our teamwork.</p>
            
        <p>One of the most memorable moments was when I participated in a basketball sports event held at the campus. This event was joined by various teams from other faculties, and the competitive atmosphere was exhilarating. My team and I trained hard for several weeks leading up to the event, and we were eager to showcase what we had learned.</p>
            
        <p>On the day of the event, we played in several matches and felt an incredible tension. Although not every match ended in victory, we were very proud of the effort and hard work we had put in. Each match was an opportunity to learn and grow, both as individuals and as a team.</p>
            
        <p>In addition to playing basketball, I also had the chance to meet many new people and build friendships. This event was not just about competition, but also about building a community and creating unforgettable memories.</p>
            
        <p>I am very grateful to have experienced such a positive holiday filled with activities. Basketball has become an important part of my life, and I hope to continue developing my skills in the future.</p>
